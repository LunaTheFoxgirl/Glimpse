# Glimpse

Glimpse Image Editor is a downstream fork of the GNU Image Manipulation Program. You can find out more information on our FAQs page: https://glimpse-editor.org/about/

## What is different about Glimpse?
For Glimpse 0.1, the main features are:
* A rebranded product suitable for schools and workplaces
* A less distracting user interface
* New Windows install options
* Improved developer tools and documentation

In future versions we intend to fix upstream Windows bugs, address long-standing complaints with the graphical user interface, and eventually produce a drop-in replacement using modern technology.

The key limitation is that Glimpse does not run on MacOS. We recommend that Apple customers try [Seashore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seashore/id1448648921?mt=12) instead.

## How will the package versions work?
0.x and 1.x will both be based on the GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10.12. You can see how our latest development efforts are progressing in the [dev-g210](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/tree/dev-g210) branch.

A front-end rewrite will also be produced in parallel, and in the longer term that will be released as Glimpse 2.x.
