                          In-Development
                   ------------------------------

This is the stable branch of Glimpse. Unlike earlier stable branches,
we do allow some new features here, if they are not too invasive.
Otherwise, this branch is only for bug-fixes.


Overview of Changes from GNU Image Manipulation Program to Glimpse 0.1.0
========================================================================
Glimpse 0.1.0 is based on GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10.12.
It also uses the following dependency package versions:
* BABL 0.1.68
* GEGL 0.4.16
* MyPaint 1.3.0

Graphical User Interface:
* Translation files, code & build files updated so "Glimpse" is displayed
throughout the UI, executables and packages
* Changed the default UI behaviour for a cleaner look
* Replaced application logo and window/taskbar icons
* Replaced Windows save file icon
* Replaced initial splash screen
* Updated upstream icon themes to include our own iconography
* Replaced links in the "Help" menu
* Updated the About window
* Removed code for upstream "easter eggs"
* Refactored version strings and compatibility notices in file save dialog
* Refactored display text for plug-ins, extensions and procedures

Code Improvements:
* Refactored the automated "authors" system for the Glimpse project
* Refactored the build system for the Glimpse project
* Removed some scripts and tooling we do not use this with this fork
* Updated the Flatpak build process and removed webkit build step for dev releases
* Updated the Snapcraft build process
* Added Travis CI support to sanity check and test builds in version control
* Created new Windows installer with the WiX toolset

Developer Assistance:
* Added BABL, GEGl and MyPaint dependencies as git submodules pre-set
at the current tagged releases
* Added Vagrant support so the code can be built & run without needing to
install the prerequisites on the host system
* Provided comprehensive build documentation for Windows and Linux at
https://wiki.glimpse-editor.org/index.php?title=Building_Glimpse
* Improved integration with the GNOME Builder IDE
* Provided new code level documentation of our own (such as code of conduct,
contributing guide, changelog, etc)

Quality of Life Improvements:
* Removed legacy upstream documentation not needed for this fork
* Changed installation & configuration files location to avoid conflicts
* Changed cached and temporary files location to avoid conflicts
* Changed process identifiers so they do not conflict with other
running instances of the GNU Image Manipulation Program
* Added our own metadata for built and packaged executables
* Removed "Color" icons (duplicates "Legacy")
* Removed "Gray" UI theme (duplicates "System")
* Updated or replaced GNOME-specific metadata files
* Maintained compatibility with existing GNU IMP v2.x plug-ins
* Refactored "Created with GIMP" notice to "Created with Glimpse"
in the default save file metadata
